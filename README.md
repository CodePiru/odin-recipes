The Odin Project
Project: Recipes (Christmas edition)

This is a really basic website, with an index page linking
to some Christmas recipes. I used the concepts I learned
in The Odin Project's Foundations course, from the start to
HTML Foundations lesson. 

The HTML concepts used are:
    - Boulderplate
    - Headings
    - Paragraphs
    - Anchors
    - Lists
    - Images
